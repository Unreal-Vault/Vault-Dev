Welcome to the Vault. An Unreal Engine 4 asset library to make sharing and reusing assets easy. 

Check out the full website for more details: [https://unreal-vault.github.io/](https://unreal-vault.github.io/)

Vault is an active development project and liable to change frequently, and it's certainly possible for bugs to creep in between submissions. The release builds are fairly stable releases and I highly recommend you stick to those for testing. 

Anyone who wants to provide feedback, suggestions, or pull requests is more than welcome too. To develop new features for this plugin, you will need a fairly decent knowledge of Unreal Slate programming. Also the files need a desperate re-factor, so they are all gonna change layout fairly soon.
